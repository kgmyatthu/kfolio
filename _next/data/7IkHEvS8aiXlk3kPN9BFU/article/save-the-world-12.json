However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n## Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n```js\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\n(Github Wiki pages don't seem to support syntax highlighting, so the above won't be colourful (the strings are not red, for example). Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.
