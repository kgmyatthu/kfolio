There are three levels of headings (`<h1>` - `<h3>`), and none of them have IDs.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Apple Pie Recipe</h1>\n    <p>This is the world's best apple pie recipe...</p>\n\n    <div>\n      <h2>Filling</h2>\n      <p>The filling is the best part...</p>\n\n      <h3>Preparing the apples</h3>\n      <p>Cut the apples into 1/4 inch slices...</p>\n\n      <h3>Preparing the spice mix</h3>\n      <p>In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon...</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div>\n      <h2>Crust</h2>\n      <p>How to make the perfect flaky crust...</p>\n\n      <h3>Preparing the dough</h3>\n      <p>Combine flour, sugar, salt...</p>\n\n      <h3>The criss-cross top</h3>\n      <p>Cut the top crust into 1/2 inch strips...</p>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**example.js**<br>\nThis script reads the `input.html` file above writes the results to `output.html` (shown below). The script uses [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), [rehype-parse](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/tree/master/packages/rehype-parse), [rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug), and [rehype-stringify](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/tree/master/packages/rehype-stringify).\n\n\n```diff\nconst unified = require(\"unified\");\nconst parse = require(\"rehype-parse\");\nconst slug = require(\"rehype-slug\");\nconst toc = require(\"@jsdevtools/rehype-toc\");\nconst stringify = require(\"rehype-stringify\");\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nasync function example() {\n  // Create a Rehype processor with the TOC plugin\n  const processor = unified()\n    .use(parse)\n+    .use(slug)\n-    .use(toc)\n    .use(stringify);\n\n  // Read the original HTML file\n  let inputHTML = await fs.promises.readFile(\"input.html\");\n\n  // Process the HTML, adding heading IDs and Table of Contents\n  let outputHTML = await processor.process(inputHTML);\n\n  // Save the new HTML\n  await fs.promises.writeFile(\"output.html\", outputHTML);\n}\n```\n\n**output.html**<br>\nHere's the HTML that gets created by the above script. Notice that a table of contents has been added at the top of the `<body>`, with links to each of the headings on the page.

[Here is an excelleng guide](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/introduction-to-unified/) to learn the basics.\n\nThe Rehype TOC plugin works just like any other Rehype plugin. Pass it to [the `.use()` method](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processoruseplugin-options), optionally with an [options object](#options).\n\n```javascript\nconst unified = require(\"unified\");\nconst toc = require(\"@jsdevtools/rehype-toc\");\n\n// Use the Rehype TOC plugin with its default options\nunified().use(toc);\n\n// Use the Rehype TOC plugin with custom options\nunified().use(toc, {\n  headings: [\"h1\", \"h2\"],     // Only include <h1> and <h2> headings in the TOC\n  cssClasses: {\n    toc: \"page-outline\",      // Change the CSS class for the TOC\n    link: \"page-link\",        // Change the CSS class for links in the TOC\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n\nOptions\n--------------------------\nThe Rehype TOC plugin supports the following options:\n\n|Option                |Type                |Default                |Description\n|:---------------------|:-------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------\n|`nav`                 |boolean             |true                   |Determines whether the table of contents is wrapped in a `<nav>` element.\n|`position`            |string              |\"afterbegin\"           |The position at which the table of contents should be inserted, relative to the `<main>` or `<body>` element.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n```js\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). \nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n\n(Github Wiki pages don't seem to support syntax highlighting, so the above won't be colourful (the strings are not red, for example). Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n```\n\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n## Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. Here are a couple of common examples:\n\n```\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Tables</th>\n    <th>Are</th>\n    <th>Cool</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Zebra</th>\n    <td>Stripes</td>\n    <td>Are</td>\n    <td>Pretty</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Here</th>\n    <td>Is</td>\n    <td>Another</td>\n    <td>Row</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Tables</th>\n    <th>Are</th>\n    <th>Cool</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Zebra</th>\n    <td>Stripes</td>\n    <td>Are</td>\n    <td>Pretty</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Here</th>\n    <td>Is</td>\n    <td>Another</td>\n    <td>Row</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nGithub-flavored Markdown supports a special table syntax, but *Markdown Here* does not support it yet. [There's an issue for it.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/13)\n\n## Horizontal Rule\n\n```\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n\n## Line Breaks\n\nMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once, then hit it twice, see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. \n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\n```\nWith only a single newline, this line and\nthis line will be a *single line*.\n\nBut this one is separated by two newlines and so will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line has two spaces at the end (hard for you to see, but trust me!).  \nSo this is a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\n\nWith only a single newline, this line and\nthis line will be a *single line*.\n\nBut this one is separated by two newlines and so will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line has two spaces at the end (hard for you to see, but trust me!).  \nSo this is a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\n$$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$\n\n\nLift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following\nequation.\n\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L\n$$\nThis is intended as a quick reference and showcase.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)\n\nAgain, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n```\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n\n## Inline HTML\n\nYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. Here are a couple of common examples:\n\n```\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\n\n```\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n```\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. \n```\n\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\n> This line is part of the same quote.\n\nQuote break.\n\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.

Here are a couple of common examples:\n\n```\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Tables</th>\n    <th>Are</th>\n    <th>Cool</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Zebra</th>\n    <td>Stripes</td>\n    <td>Are</td>\n    <td>Pretty</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Here</th>\n    <td>Is</td>\n    <td>Another</td>\n    <td>Row</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Definition list</dt>\n  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>\n\n  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>\n  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well.

[There's an issue for it.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/13)\n\n## Horizontal Rule\n\n```\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n***\n\nAsterisks\n\n___\n\nUnderscores\n\n## Line Breaks\n\nMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once, then hit it twice, see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. \n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\n```\nWith only a single newline, this line and\nthis line will be a *single line*.\n\nBut this one is separated by two newlines and so will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line has two spaces at the end (hard for you to see, but trust me!).  \nSo this is a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n```\n\nWith only a single newline, this line and\nthis line will be a *single line*.\n\nBut this one is separated by two newlines and so will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line has two spaces at the end (hard for you to see, but trust me!).  \nSo this is a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\n$$\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \\right)$$\n\n\nLift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following\nequation.\n\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L\n$$\n","date":"2021-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["cryptography","algorithm","math"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
